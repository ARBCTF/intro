# Introduction

So, what is a CTF? CTF stands for **C**apture **T**he **F**lag. No, not like running around
and capturing literal flags...

CTFs are a way to develop computer security knowledge and skills. They often
come in the form of **short, objectively measurable exercises**. Many CTF
participants will be offensive security professionals, but these skills are
also valuable for software engineers and people with defense in mind. To
protect against attackers you will often be required to think like one.

Skills and knowledge in the following areas are helpful:

* Cryptography
* Vulnerability discovery
* Exploit development
* Computer forensics
* Web application security
* Operating system internals
* Computer networks
* Toolkit creation
* Operation tradecraft

Don't worry if you don't have these skills yet! We're here to learn.
Participating in CTFs can be very challenging, but that's a good thing. If
you're not frustrated you're not learning anything.

With that in mind, let's get to work!
